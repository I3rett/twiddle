**TWIDDLE AWAY**<br>
Twiddle is the only trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder) app on the App Store.

**MADE FOR THE APPLE WATCH**<br>
Twiddle is a stand-alone app with no barriers or log-in screen to bypass. 
It's there for when you need it, and you can jump straight in and begin relieving urges to pull right away. 
Add a complication to your favourite watch face for instance emergency relief. 

**POWERED BY THE DIGITAL CROWN**<br>
Twiddle makes uses of the Digital Crown as a fidget toy - displaying a range of illustrations as users twiddle away.
The Digital Crown's small size and haptic feedback are perfect to replicate the pinch and tactilities familiar with hair pulling. 

**BEYOND TRICH**<br>
Although primarily made to help curb trichotillomania pulling, Twiddle can also be used to treat other obsessive compulsive disorders...or simply used as a fun fidget toy!
